Model Weights
This project supports YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 models. You can download pre-trained model weights or train your own models. The weights can be found at model-weights/. You can also specify the path to custom weights when running the detection script.

Demo
You can watch a demo video showcasing the project's object detection capabilities at Demo Video.

Customization
If you want to train your own custom models, you can follow the instructions in the Customization Guide. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for training YOLO models on your specific dataset.
